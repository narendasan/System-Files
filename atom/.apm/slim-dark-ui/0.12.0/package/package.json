Based on the Atom One dark UI\n\n### Install\n\nThis theme is installed by default with Atom and can be activated by going to the __Settings > Themes__ section and selecting \"Slim Dark\" from the __UI Themes__ drop-down menu.\n\n### Settings\n\nIn the theme settings you can switch between 3 __Layout Modes__:\n\n1. `Auto` (default) - In Auto mode, the UI and font size will automatically change based on the window size.\n2. `Compact` - The UI stays compact to leave more space for the editor.\n3. `Spacious` - The UI is expanded, giving some breathing room.\n\nAs well as change the __Font Size__ to scale the whole UI up or down.\n\n### Customize\n\nIt's also possible to resize only certain areas by adding the following to your `styles.less` (Use the DevTools to find the right selectors):\n\n```css\n.theme-slim-dark-ui {\n  .tab-bar { font-size: 18px; }\n  .tree-view { font-size: 14px; }\n  .status-bar { font-size: 12px; }\n}\n```\n\n### FAQ\n\n__Why do the colors change when I switch Syntax themes.__\nThis UI theme uses the same background color as the chosen Syntax theme. In case that Syntax theme has a light background color, it only uses its hue, but otherwise stays dark. This lets you use dark-light combos.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Tehnix/slim-dark-ui/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/Tehnix/slim-dark-ui","_id":"slim-dark-ui@0.12.0","_shasum":"c55457dfe8fa14e44b9d2c1d64d456760fd8c4a3","_resolved":"file:../d-115527-25314-1fp1leu/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115527-25314-1fp1leu/package.tgz"}

## Accents UI theme

This theme is meant to provide a subtle interface for distraction free coding, with coloured accents (that can be configured). Popular/Useful packages get some attention too, and are adjusted visually to work with the theme!

You can change the accent colour in the theme's settings.  
Some colours that work great:  

*Crimson*: `#d2372b` `(210,55,43)`  
*Shamrock*: `#2ad574` `(42,213,116)`  
*Maroon*: `#d43167` `(212,49,103)`  
*Azure*: `#1e91f0` `(30,145,240)`  

*Note: Accent colour changes won't take effect until you reload atom `[View] -> [Reload]`*

Inspired by Brogrammer UI, which I've been a fond user of in Sublime and Atom.

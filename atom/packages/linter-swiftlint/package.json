Used with files that have the `Swift` syntax.\n\n## Installation\nLinter package must be installed in order to use this plugin. If Linter is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).\n\nAs well, install [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint).\n\n### Plugin installation\n```\n$ apm install linter-swiftlint\n```\n\n## Settings\nUsing the Settings for the Package you may change the state of any of these properties to change how files are linted:\n- `Live Linting` when enabled lints the current state of the current file in a temporary directory, this breaks relative requirements, but this mode is useful if writing a script. When disabled the file is linted in the directory it's saved in at save and opening, keeping in tact relative requirements.\n\n## Contributing\nIf you would like to contribute enhancements or fixes, please do the following:\n\n1. Fork the plugin repository.\n1. Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master`.\n1. Commit and push the topic branch.\n1. Make a pull request.\n1. welcome to the club\n\nPlease note that modifications should follow these coding guidelines:\n\n- Indent is 2 spaces.\n- Code should pass coffeelint linter.\n- Vertical whitespace helps readability, donâ€™t be afraid to use it.\n\nThank you for helping out!\n",
